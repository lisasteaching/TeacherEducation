# Pythagorean Theorm Life Application Webquest

The Life Application webquest for the Pythagorean Theorem has three phases:</p>

* Phase 1: Consider a real-life scenario. Break down the problem by drawing a diagram to show known and unknown information and by researching possibilities to satisfy the criterion.
* Phase 2: Create a table to organize your information. Synthesize and evaluate all possible solutions against given criterion and propose a solution.
* Phase 3: Create your own problem that requires the Pythagorean Theorem. Include at least one criterion that requires gathering information to compare and contrast two or more options. Solve your problem.

# Pythagorean Theorm History and Proof Webquest

The History and Proof webquest for the Pythagorean Theorem has three phases:</p>

* Phase 1: Read about Pythagoras, tell a little bit about his life, and paraphrase how he discovered the proof.
* Phase 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem given values to plug into the formula.
* Phase 3: Evaluate three proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem and select one to paraphrase and reconstruct.

# Do Everything Twice

The anticipatory set in this lesson engages students in a story that portrays a real-life scenario with a fictional twist. The story leads logically into the lesson where students discover the addition and subtraction properties of equality and develop a procedure for solving equations with them.
